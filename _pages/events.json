One of Niagara's most prestigious awards, this annual program recognizes 40 business people under the age of 40 who have demonstrated an extraordinary level of success in the private, public and non-profit sectors.\n\nBusiness Link has hosted 18 years of Annual 40 Under Forty Business Achievement Awards. The primary purpose of our annual awards banquet is to give back to the Niagara region while identifying individuals and businesses that greatly contribute to the growth and development of our community. To date we have recognized the successes of 720 business leaders across the Niagara region.\n\nTurning challenges into opportunities, BLMG has overcome the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic by holding the award ceremony as an online event. By doing so,not only we have not allowed the situation to hinder the celebration of our Niagara business talents, but we have also expanded the reach and availability of the awards ceremony to a potential audience of thousands more with a virtually ever-lasting time frame.\n",
